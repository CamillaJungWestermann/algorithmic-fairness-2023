    "\n",
    "As in the lecture, individuals that have the target (T = 1) are drawn in blue, others (T = 0) are drawn in red. G = 0 refers to the triangle group, G = 1 refers to the circle group. Different to the lecture material, the visual split-up happens by selection status, not by target. \n",

    "**Remark:** You might find it easier to solve this task by writing some code.\n",

    "    - If we want to maximize the profit using a single threshold, which one would it be?\n",

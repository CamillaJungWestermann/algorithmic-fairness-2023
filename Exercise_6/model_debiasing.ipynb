    "##### A little clarification and tips:\n",
    "1. In order to simplify the exercise - we cut some corners. *Ideally* we should calculate the gradient in respect to the *individual fairness*. The gradient takes into the account only logistic and l2 loss (aka, parameters are updated based on those). At the same time, our *cost* has a *individual fairness* included. When the update of the parameters stops decreasing the cost, the `fmin_tnc` is going to stop optimisation. So our implementation is not entirely correct.\n",
    "2. In case you want to have a more correct implementation, you can do `opt.fmin_tnc(func=compute_cost, x0=betas, fprime = None, approx_grad= True, ...)`. It is quite long, but you can still do it\n",
    "3. I also suggest setting `ftol=1e-5`. \n",
    "4. Don not apply l2-regularization on the intercept (when you calculate the gradient).\n",
    "5. You should include $x_0 = 1$ in your data, for each observation (when it comes to the manual implementation of logistic regression) to include bias (i.e. weight $\\beta_0$).\n",
    "6. To keep the exercise simpler, let's fix $\\gamma = 1e-5$.\n",
    "7. Try $lambda$ is a range from around $1$ to $1e5$."

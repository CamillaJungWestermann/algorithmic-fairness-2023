If you have worked already with the COMPAS dataset and find the exercise boring or redundant, consider working on the other exercises, or working on analyzing possible biases in a data set of your choice**\n",

    "#### Data Cleaning\n",
    "Now that we have surveyed the dataset, let's look into cleaning the data. This data-cleaning is largely based off of ProPublica's methods. Requerements for the data filtering:\n",
    "1. We only focus on cases where the COMPAS scored crime happened within +/- 30 days from when the person was arrested (if the value is missing, the record shoudl be removed). \n",
    "2. Then, we also get rid of cases where is_recid is -1 since we only want binary values for the purpose of our model (0 for no recidivism, 1 for yes recidivism). \n",
    "3. Finally, we don't want the c_charge_degree to be \"O\" which denotes ordinary traffic offenses (not as serious of a crime). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finish cleaning the dataset by filling in the code below based on the description above. The cleaned dataset should have 6172 records and 13 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "(***Optional**) Create a \"Lenghts of stay in jail\" feature (you can compute this feature using `c_jail_in` and `c_jail_out`) and use it in the exercise*"
